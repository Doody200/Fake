 Gateman

Have you ever heard of CA, the legendary land of magic? Well, now you have.

It all started when John decided to buy a firearm. The path he takes to get to his job is quite dangerous. CA is known for its popular alleyways, which John had to pass through on his way to work as a gateman for a lab that conducted endless experiments. This earned him the nickname Gateman among his friends.

One day, a gun was used for one of the experiments, and John asked his manager to buy it for half the price. But, of course, the manager didn't agree, fearing the potential side effects. However, eventually, he gave in. John was happy, but his happiness didn't last long as a black spot appeared on his stomach. Every time he held the gun, the spot grew bigger, gradually consuming his entire stomach. He had to tell his manager about it, but he was afraid of having to return the firearm, so he chose not to mention it.

One night, his eye randomly turned red, then went back to normal, and on another night, his leg became significantly more powerful.

One day, while heading to work, he started acting strangely and developed a peculiar desire to bite the gate's bar. His friends noticed his odd behavior and informed the manager themselves. That's when everything changed. The manager's face went pale, revealing that he had read about a similar phenomenon in a book called Black Lock. It described opposite names, like Gateman and Nametag. So, they playfully dubbed him Nametag. However, the real challenge was finding a cure. The only known remedy was created by a witch named Zelda, who resided in a dangerous swamp. They decided to embark on a journey there, but they had only one day to reach her, or John would remain stuck in his altered form. Fortunately, they arrived just in time, but the price they paid was the loss of one of their friends. This event came to be known as the "Gateman Nametag Crisis."

After successfully reaching Zelda and obtaining the cure, John's body gradually returned to its normal state. The black spot on his stomach disappeared, and his eye and leg returned to their original condition. Grateful for the support and bravery of his friends, John decided to honor the memory of the fallen friend who sacrificed their life during the quest. He organized a memorial in their honor, gathering all those who had been touched by the "Gateman Nametag Crisis" to pay tribute and celebrate their friend's courage.
